Centered in this data, generate several observations for different levels of Gaussian noise. For the Q range of the data see Fig 1. \n",
    "- For each of the observation sets, perform a Bayesian calibration of a straight line and a parabola. Compare how the Bias and Variance (See Figure 2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05706) change as the noise level increases. You can also explore fixing the noise value but changing the total number of points, or their locations. \n",
